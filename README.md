💻 Multithread Simulator – Producer-Consumer Model

A graphical multithreading simulator built with Python, Tkinter, Monitor & Semaphore synchronization.

🚀 Project Overview

This project visualizes the classical Producer–Consumer problem using two synchronization mechanisms:

Monitor (Lock + Condition Variables)

Semaphore-based Buffer Control

It provides a complete GUI-based simulation that helps users understand thread scheduling, waiting, running, blocking, and buffer operations clearly and interactively.

🧩 Features

Producer & Consumer simulation

Monitor and Semaphore modes

Real-time activity log with timestamps

Thread state tracking panel

Neon-themed GUI

Animated buffer slot visualization

Gantt-style timeline showing thread states

Adjustable speeds for producer/consumer threads

Start / Stop / Reset controls
